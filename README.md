# Visualization SGA expense detail and redistribution
STANLEY Healthcare's Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A) expense detail is split across four ERP systems (2 Instances of Great Plains, SAP and Priority). As the business targets to reduce and/or reallocate SG&A investments to new initiatives, we need to develop a "visualization tool" that will allow us to consolidate the SG&A expenses from four systems in a manner that aligns with our Oracle Hyperion Financial Reporting (HFM) account structure
Approach:
Create a customized SQL query in Tableau to develop a re-usable framework for data cleaning
Use custom joins in the code to merge tables from different ERP systems and select those columns which provide the expense data across      different dimensional attributes
Develop visulaization charts and dashboards in Tableu to analyze the trends based on the business conidtions.
